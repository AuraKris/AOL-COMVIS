This is a small computer vision course project on classifying lung cancer with a dataset from kaggle. 
This project was intended to combine a proposed framework by another paper to mask the lung cancer images, reducing its noise which increases the overall accuracy.
A simple interface was also created to showcase the prediction of each input images.
